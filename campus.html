            </div>
            <p><br>iACADEMY’s first campus was along Ayala Avenue in Makati. It first offered College courses on Software
                Engineering, Network Engineering, <br>e-Management, and Digital Arts. The school grew its course offerings.
                In 2007, iACADEMY was the first to offer BS Animation in the Philippines. As the College program
                offerings grew, the student population grew with it. By 2014, iACADEMY transferred to another building
                along Buendia Avenue in Makati. The school started offering Senior High School in 2016 and the student
                population has grown exponentially that by 2017 the school had to build a bigger, newer, even better
                space for learning. Hence, the iACADEMY Nexus along Yakal St. still in Makati, closer to partner
                companies where industry practitioners and professors for iACADEMY come from opened in 2018.<br></p>
            <p><br>iACADEMY’s unique approach to education has gained traction and has been awarded IBM Center of Excellence
                in the ASEAN Region, UNITY training and certification center, PwC Accountancy school partner, Toon Boom
                Center of Excellence, Most Innovative School, among others. See full list of awards.<br></p>

                type of education that iACADEMY offers closer to people. In 2023, iACADEMY opened its first regional
                campus in Cebu IT Park. Its initial offerings are Software Engineering, Game Development, Real Estate
                Management, Animation, and Multimedia Arts and Design. Maintaining the same academic and facilities
                quality that its main campus offers, the unique Cebu campus design is filled with high-tech classrooms,
                multipurpose hall, Cintiq room, light box room, green room, multimedia laboratory, computer
                laboratories, and a very inviting student lounge.<br></p>
